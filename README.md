Crescendo Collective - Frontend Skill Test
Goals

For this javascript project we've provided a recipe API with two endpoints. With this API you'll need to complete the following objectives.

    Pull the data from the API
    Create a list view which includes all the recipes
    Create a recipe detail view to display each recipe
    Ingredients with a matching ingredientId listed in the specials response should also show the special title, type and text under the ingredient name
    Bonus: Create a view to add and update recipes or specials. Image upload not required. Both endpoints support GET, POST and PATCH.
